I dove into Gatsby today. After watching a few different Youtube "crash courses", I set off to create this visual logger for my 100 Days of Code. I'm hoping that giving myself this public forum will help keep me motivated and accountable for coding each day + providing updates.

Building this also gave me a chance to play with Material UI + custom Mui themes.

### Day 2: February 10th Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More progress on the canvas of the Pomodoro Clock. Worked on CSS (still figuring out Flexbox things), have done some work with HTML5 canvas.

**Thoughts:** It's a bit frustrating to spend a lot of time figuring out how the canvas works.

### Day 3: February 11th Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Mostly worked on CSS. Coded very late at night, after French.

**Thoughts:** Had some CSS breakthroughs, and was happy at the end.
