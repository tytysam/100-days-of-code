# 100 Days of Code | Log

## Tyler Samuelson - Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

### Day 1: Tuesday, February 9th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />
I dove into Gatsby today. After watching a few different Youtube "crash courses", I set off to create this visual "logger" for my 100 Days of Code. I'm hoping that giving myself this public forum will help keep me motivated and accountable for coding each day + providing updates.

Building this also gave me a chance to play with Material UI + custom Mui themes.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Continueing to invest in breadth before I invest heavily in depth. Those days are not far off though. React/Redux/Next + Vue/Vuex/Nuxt here I come.

### Day 2: Wednesday, February 10th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />
A little less code, but a lot of video content today. Reading articles + watching videos about GitLab and Unit Testing. Trying to fill some knowledge gaps around DevOps lifecycle tools + CI/CD + deployment pipelines.

Also spent a fair amount of time messing around with Material UI and my custom MUI theme for this site.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Gatsby was not near as fun to develop with (_yet_ at least üôà) as everyone's been telling me... However, I will say it is FAST. Once I figure out some of the nuance, Learned lots about GitLab and DevOps though!

### Day 3: Thursday, February 11th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Today was all about the CSS. As a designer at heart, one of my absolute favorite things is playing around in CSS and seeing how I can shift the tone / feel / emotions of a site without ever touching the content. There is so much storytelling that happens implicitly in design ‚Äî trying to harness and focus that storytelling is always a fun exercise.

Bootstrap is likely still my go-to framework, but today was all about Tailwind.

I also threw some time at playing with some more complicated CSS animations / transitions... Read a really great piece by <a href="https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/meaningful-motion-w-action-driven-animation" target="_blank" >Tobias Ahlin</a> about Meaningful Motion with Action-Driven Animation. Spoke to using action-driven animation rather than state-driven animation... super interesting. More to come!

**Thoughts:**
<br />
I had almost 5 hours worth of programming for GA's Outcomes today, so that took a huge chunk of my day. Needed to slow down a bit, so CSS was a some nice comfort food for my brain.

### Day 4: Friday, February 12th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Had a busier day today + it was Friday, so I didn't have quite as much time to throw at code today as I would've liked.

However, I tried to at least get a couple hours throughout the day working on Algo challenges in LeetCode. I've used HackerRank and some others for code practice, but had never actually used LeetCode until today. So, I got an account setup and dove into a few 'easy' algorithm challenges. Made it all of the way through 'Plus One' and 'Sqrt(x)' (eventually).

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Really enjoy working through algorithms when I can finally force myself to sit down and just work through them. Fun mental exercises. Hoping to integrate daily (or daily-ish) LeetCode challenges into my schedule here soon.

### Day 5: Saturday, February 13th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Dedicated today to familiarizing myself with technologies that I currently only really know the name of‚Ä¶ in other words, a pleasant, albeit cold Denver afternoon of hot coffee + Youtube and simple coding examples. ‚ÄúCrash course‚Äù highlights include: Docker, Kubernetes, Drupal, GCP, and Regular Expressions.

Also spent some time with Dan Abramov's <a href="https://whatthefuck.is/" target="_blank">whatthefuck.is</a>, a nice little (but growing) compendium of explanation-worthy JS terms. (Sidenote: I can never help but recommend Dan's <a href="https://justjavascript.com/" target="_blank">JustJavaScript "course"</a> to anyone new to programming, or anyone who enjoys exploring mental models!)

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Learned in lots of directions today, which kinda feels a little obtuse, but I personally see a lot of value in having basic understandings of what each of these technologies are at their most simple level (if only to build better mental models of how they interact/pair with other technologies).

### Day 6: Sunday, February 14th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Fine-tuned my Figma skills! I've been playing around with a few different programs for designing mockups + wireframes, and I've really come to enjoy Figma. Planning to be better about using Figma (or an equivalent) on non-client work too to get plenty more chances to practice it.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Figma might just have earned itself a spot as my default prototyping tool at this point.

### Day 7: Monday, February 15th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Today was spent refining the mobile-responsiveness of my portfolio site.

Check out my <a href="http://www.tylercsamuelson.com" target="_blank">portfolio site</a> and be sure to let me know if your phone's display looks anything less than clean | clear | crisp.

Also finally sat down and integrated Google Analytics into my site, so now I have a nice flow of #data.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Few things better/worse than a gracious soul reaching out to let you know that your site looks ~not-great on [XYZ Device].

### Day 8: Tuesday, February 16th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Started exploring VS Code documentation around developing your own extensions! I've had a few ideas popping around my head for a bit now, so I'm stoked to have familiarized myself with the development process!

VS Code's documentation is super thorough and clear ‚Äî if anyone is interested, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension" target="_blank">this is the documentation</a> that I was reading this morning.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Keep an eye on this space: I may have more than just an example-extension built before long üòè

### Day 9: Wednesday, February 17th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Code-time today was devoted to making sure every piece of my portfolio is as buttoned-up as it can be!

I wasted over an hour trying to get Google Analytics firing to no avail. Then diverted the rest of my time to refining mobile responsiveness through media queries.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Overall, I'm very happy with the UI and UX of my site ‚Äî it's clean, crisp, and intuitive while also showcasing my personality. Definitely plenty more that could be added (I'm planning to add lots more detail to my project pages... eventually) but for the immediate, I'm pretty happy with how it's looking.

### Day 10: Thursday, February 18th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

I‚Äôve spent the past week throwing time at disparate topics that had ended up on the back-burner + generally just chasing random curiosities, which has been super fun and energizing in its own right.

But now I‚Äôm planning to shift gears and focus on refining what I already know, SO: to kick things off, I‚Äôm going back to where it all started for me‚Ä¶ React!

To get back into it, I made a simple little web application that uses Google's Translate API to translate input text from English to the selected output language.

Here's what I focused on reinforcing today:

- useState and useEffect hooks
- Making an API call with Axios
- Structuring my own data models
- API setup and auth through Google

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Had a lot of fun debugging today. Absolutely love the satisfaction of finally solving a bug that's been plaguing you.

### Day 11: Friday, February 19th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Started today with more topical videos about Docker and Kubernetes. Trying to make I have solid literacy and comprehension, even if I'm not working with the technologies super often.

After that general learning, I zeroed-in on React.

Here's what I focused on today:

- Building content with JSX
- Deep dive into the nuances of create-react-app
- Building some content with JSX

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Really enjoying exploring React in a front-to-back kind of way again. Tomorrow I'm focusing on communicating with Props + taking a deeper dive into structuring apps with class-based components.

### Day 12: Saturday, February 20th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Kicked today off with a couple fun articles about some advanced SVG and CSS manipulations. Now I'm looking for excuses to animate bezier curves in CSS ‚Äî stay tuned..

Otherwise, I circled back to React after my fun-focused reads.

Here's how I split my time:

- Communicating with props
- Structuring apps with class-based components
- Handling async operations with functional components
- Refactoring from functional to class components
- State in React components

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Today's content got a lot of fun ideas stirred up, so I'm stoked to carve out some time for personal projects ASAP as possible... :)

### Day 13: Sunday, February 21st

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Got an early start to Day #13 of #100DaysOfCode!

Made some coffee and started my morning by refactoring some portions of my portfolio site. Helped organize + eliminate some edge case issues with responsiveness. Also added a section highlighting some of my recent projects.

Check out the updates here üëáüèª
<a href="http://www.tylercsamuelson.com/" target="_blank">www.tylercsamuelson.com</a>

After that, I spent time deepening my understanding of React lifecycle methods. Then debugged a couple pagination issues with my 100 Days of Code log.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Trying to maintain momentum on my daily: learning + code work + publishing efforts + job searching... Phew.

### Day 14: Monday, February 22nd

**Today's Progress**:
<br />
Happy Monday!

After a few days of troubleshooting, I finally have data reporting from Google Analytics! I hadn't installed tracking code into a website in a little while + my portfolio is built with express-react-views and JSX, it took some finnagling to get the code firing in the right spots. Nice win to start the week!

After that, I set aside some time to work on LinkedIn Skill Assessments ‚Äî check out my new skill badges <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tcsamuelson/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Finally, I did my daily React. Didn't do a ton today as I diverted more of my time to job-centric things today. That said, I still made time to work on handling user input with forms + events and making API requests with React.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Ebb and flow of productivity. Got tons done in regard to job searching + applying and skills assessments today. Less code, though. More tomorrow!

### Day 15: Tuesday, February 23rd

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Today was all about React!

Here's how I split my time:

- Making API requests with React
- Axios vs Fetch
- Binding callbacks
- Extracting options to config objects
- Controlled Forms vs Uncontrolled Forms

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Today was all about React! Really enjoying this front-to-back review of knowledge that I've been working through ‚Äî such a gratifying feeling to just _get_ concepts that seemed so deeply dense and confusing just a couple months back.

### Day 16: Wednesday, February 24th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Spent today building a simple Youtube clone. This React-based app uses the Youtube Data API to take user input from a search field and return multiple videos from Youtube based on your search terms. User can play video in native video player component, or can select a different video from the search results.

I built this simple app in order to reinforce my understanding of the following topics:

- Crafting controlled forms
- Accessing and utilizing Google's Youtube Data API
- Building an app using class-based components rather than functional components
- Leveraging state and lifecycle methods SANS hooks
- Dynamic rendering based on state
- Making calls with Axios
- Styling content using Semantic-UI

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Fun day of building! Could have thrown more time at styling, but I accomplished the core of what I was wanting to do, which is reinforce my React knowledge.

### Day 17: Thursday, February 25th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />
I've been curious about jQuery lately, so I spent my morning on Youtube working through some topical videos that helped shore-up my base-knowledge of the library. Also completed a couple more LinkedIn Skills Assessments.

After that, my attention naturally shifted back to React. Here's what today's focal points were:

- Hooks in React! (specifically: useState, useEffect, useRef)
- Dynamically toggling classes using state
- Async code in useEffect
- XSS attacks in React
- Throttling API requests
- Event Bubbling
- Debouncing

The project I kicked off to practice all of that^ isn't done yet, but I'm hoping to have everything working by tomorrow afternoon ü§òüèª

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Longggg day of code today. Lots of jQuery in the morning, and then React allllll afternoon. Feeling tired, but should have this collection of widgets finished up by tomorrow.

### Day 18: Friday, February 26th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />
Worked on finishing my collection of simple React Widgets today!

Here's what makes up the "collection":

- An Accordion-style component for displaying content (specifically, hiding/showing)
- A Wikipedia-powered Search app
- A custom dropdown-style component
- A Google Translate API-powered translator app

This is what I ened up getting exposure to today:

- Lots of JSX!
- Binding event handlers
- Filtering lists
- Hiding and showing lists (dynamic rendering using classes)
- Building navigation without React-Router

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Made it through the longest lesson in my queue today (~5 hours) so that felt AWESOME. Everything else will hopefully feel like cake by comparison.

### Day 19: Saturday, February 27th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />
Slowed things down a little today to give myself a bit of a breather.

Spent pretty much the entire day of code refactoring my mini-Youtube Clone. I originally used the project as an excuse to refamiliarize myself with lifecycle methods + class-based components, but now I'm doing a quick rebuild to shift to using Hooks.

Here's what I practiced along the way:

- Refactoring from state to useState
- Refactoring from lifecycle methods to ~useEffect
- Building custom hooks
- Extracting video fetching logic to a custom hook

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Only spent a couple hours on code today rather than the 4+ I've generally been throwing at it through the week. Needed a day to recharge + reset a bit.

### Day 20: Sunday, February 28th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />
Feeling really solid about my React fundamentals, so today we step it up a notch with Redux!

I've used Redux for state management in a couple of my more complicated projects, but it's still felt relatively convoluted to implement, so I'm dedicated to becoming more comfortable with the fundamentals of Redux. Today I'm kicking off some deep dives, starting with gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the Redux Cycle.

Here's what I worked on along the way:

- Modeling with Redux
- Building Action Creators
- Creating Reducers
- Rules of Reducers

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Picked up a lot of really nuanced, helpful notes about Redux today!

### Day 21: Monday, March 1st

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Started my Monday off with some learning focused on Liquid, Shopify's templating language. I was really surprised how much it had in common with Ruby!

Here's what I learned about Liquid in Action:

- First, a user requests a URL of a Shopify store
- Then, Shopify works out which store is being requested
- Then, Shopify selects the required Liquid template from the active theme directory
- After that, the Liquid placeholders are replaced with real data stored on Shopify
- The compiled HTML file is then sent to the browser
- And finally, the browser processes the HTML file and fetches all other required assets (images, JS, CSS, etc.)

After my early-morning lessons in Liquid, my attention shifted back to Redux. Today was all about integrating React with Redux, so I wrote a simple song selector app where you can click on a song from a list and have a Display component automatically update to display the information related to that selected song.

This simple build gave me an excuse to become more familiar with:

- Planning a Redux Project
- Named vs Default Exports
- Building reducers
- Wiring up Providers
- The Connect Function
- Configuring Connect with MapStateToProps
- Building a list with Redux data

**Thoughts:**
<br />
New week, new goals! Still working through React / Redux / React Native, but trying to add a few spicy bits alongside.

### Day 22: Tuesday, March 2nd

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Keeping the Redux train rolling today! I spent my morning today doing a take-home technical interview and the afternoon learning about Asynchronous Actions with Redux Thunk!

Here are the highlights:

- Redux Thunk and why we need it...
- Tricking Redux with Dummy Reducers
- Fetching data in a Redux App
- Making requests from an action creator
- Understanding (deeply) async action creators
- Middlewares in Redux
- Shortened Syntax with Redux Thunk

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Tiredddd from my interview / skills test. So taking it slightly easier today. Long lesson lined up for tomorrow though!

### Day 23: Wednesday, March 3rd

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Led today with some more early-morning Liquid lessons! I've built a couple (simple) Shopify storefronts in the past, but diving into the depths of customization has been a ton of fun.

After that, I returned focus to my simple Redux blog project I've been building for a couple days now.

Some topics from today's learning include:

- Pure Reducers
- Edge cases re: mutating a Reducer's input state argument
- Safe State Updates in Reducers
- Equality of Arrays and Objects
- Switch Statements in Reducers
- Dispatching correct values
- Extracting logic to mapStateToProps
- Memoizing Functions
- Action Creators inside of Action Creators!

Tomorrow we move onto React Router and maybe mess with some authentication.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Took my entire morning, but I made it through Stephen Grider's ~longest section of lessons. Win in my book.

### Day 24: Thursday, March 4th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Shifted game plans just a little today...

I was originally planning on jumping into React Router, but a week straight of working with Redux has my brain feeling fried.. So I played around with customizing some features in a custom Shopify store!

A couple things I worked on:

- Custom components that can be edited from the Shopify frontend CMS
- Working with grids and building some columned sections
- Sticky headers!
- Hover effects for images

Tomorrow we circle back to React!

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Full-disclosure: I had to recover after going out with some friends from my GA cohort last night, which was part of why today was slow on the code front... So very worth it to get to finally meet those folks face-to-face rather than over Zoom though! :)

### Day 25: Friday, March 5th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

1/4 of the way through my first #100DaysOfCode challenge ‚Äî dang time flies when you're learning!

I've had this plan on the backburner for a bit now, but am finally making time to tackle... A Twitch.tv clone!

As a mega-nerd and lover of all things gaming and tech-related, this has been a planned side-project for awhile, and has a certain symbolism to it...

It'll just be a simple-ish clone, but I'm excited to build nonetheless! The plan is to use Open Broadcaster Software to supply the video feed, build a basic Real Time Message Protocol Server, a simple server to track which streams are broadcasting, and a user interface for viewing those streams.

Kicked things off on the client-side by laying the framework with React and Redux. Scaffolded components + wired-up initial routing. Added a basic Header and styling.

Here are some challenges I anticipate running into along the way:

- Need to be able to navigate around to separate pages in the app (Hello, React-Router)
- Need to allow a user to login/logout (Google OAuth practice, probably)
- Need to handle forms in Redux (Let's Learn Redux Form!!)
- Need to master my CRUD operations in React/Redux

Tomorrow, we move on to authorization using OAuth.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
I've been doing so much learning (both for my own satisfaction and spurred by technical interviews + code challenges) that I've missed building things! It's only been like, two days since a heavy-ish build day too. Hopefully that means I'm in the right field!

### Day 26: Saturday, March 6th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

OAuth Authorization was the flavor of the day today!

Did some early-morning reading about the differences between OAuth for Servers and OAuth for JS Browser Apps. After installing a basic OAuth implementation, I then integrated Redux on top.

It's only the basic scaffoling + OAuth at the moment, but if you're interested, you can check out my Twitch.ty app <a href="https://tcs-simple-twitch-clone.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.

A few highlights from today:

- Creating OAuth credentials
- Wiring up the Google API Library
- Updating authorization state
- Handling Auth Status through Redux
- Practice with Redux Dev Tools

Tomorrow, we're gonna try to tackle Redux Forms!

**Thoughts:**
<br />
This was only my ~fourth / ~fifth time building with Redux, but I must say it has become CONSIDERABLY easier the more that I continue to work with it.

### Day 27: Sunday, March 7th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Happy Sunday! Today kicked-off with some reading about Redux and then I spent a little time setting up + refamiliarizing myself with Advanced Redux Dev Tools.

PSA: If anyone else is trying to play around with Redux's DevTools, Airbnb has their Redux Store Data publicly available. Just go to airbnb.com, open your Redux DevTools, and start exploring!

After I finished playing with those new toys, I shifted focus to Redux Forms.. Highlights are below!

- Installed + connected Redux Forms
- Customized form fields
- Added form validation
- Integrated error handling and visual error cues on form fields

Tomorrow, we shift focus to building out the REST-based functions of this React app.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Really nice feeling my confidence in my code continue to build and build :)
