# 100 Days of Code | Log

## Tyler Samuelson - Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

### Day 1: Tuesday, February 9th

**Today's Progress**:
<br />
I dove into Gatsby today. After watching a few different Youtube "crash courses", I set off to create this visual "logger" for my 100 Days of Code. I'm hoping that giving myself this public forum will help keep me motivated and accountable for coding each day + providing updates.

Building this also gave me a chance to play with Material UI + custom Mui themes.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Continueing to invest in breadth before I invest heavily in depth. Those days are not far off though. React/Redux/Next + Vue/Vuex/Nuxt here I come.

### Day 2: February 10th Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
<br />
A little less code, but a lot of video content today. Reading articles + watching videos about GitLab and Unit Testing. Trying to fill some knowledge gaps around DevOps lifecycle tools + CI/CD + deployment pipelines.

Also spent a fair amount of time messing around with Material UI and my custom MUI theme for this site.

**Thoughts:**
<br />
Gatsby was not near as fun to develop with (_yet_ at least ðŸ™ˆ) as everyone's been telling me... However, I will say it is FAST. Once I figure out some of the nuance, Learned lots about GitLab and DevOps though!

### Day 3: February 11th Thursday

**Today's Progress**:
<br />

Today was all about the CSS. As a designer at heart, one of my absolute favorite things is playing around in CSS and seeing how I can shift the tone / feel / emotions of a site without ever touching the content. There is so much storytelling that happens implicitly in design â€” trying to harness and focus that storytelling is always a fun exercise.

Bootstrap is likely still my go-to framework, but today was all about Tailwind.

I also threw some time at playing with some more complicated CSS animations / transitions... Read a really great piece by <a href="https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/meaningful-motion-w-action-driven-animation" target="_blank" >Tobias Ahlin</a> about Meaningful Motion with Action-Driven Animation. Spoke to using action-driven animation rather than state-driven animation... super interesting. More to come!

**Thoughts:**
<br />
I had almost 5 hours worth of programming for GA's Outcomes today, so that took a huge chunk of my day. Needed to slow down a bit, so CSS was a some nice comfort food for my brain.
