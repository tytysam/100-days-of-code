## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - Tyler Samuelson

### Day 1: February 8th Monday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time fixing CSS and figuring out how canvas works.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.

### Day 2: February 9th Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More progress on the canvas of the Pomodoro Clock. Worked on CSS (still figuring out Flexbox things), have done some work with HTML5 canvas.

**Thoughts:** It's a bit frustrating to spend a lot of time figuring out how the canvas works.
