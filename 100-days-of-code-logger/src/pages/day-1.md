I dove into Gatsby today. After watching a few different Youtube "crash courses", I set off to create this visual logger for my 100 Days of Code. I'm hoping that giving myself this public forum will help keep me motivated and accountable for coding each day + providing updates.

Building this also gave me a chance to play with Material UI + custom Mui themes.
