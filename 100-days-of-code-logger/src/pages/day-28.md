Week #4 of #100DaysOfCode!

I spent the morning helping a friend smooth-out some CSS woes on one of his project sites. I know plenty of people who shudder at the thought of complex CSS, but honestly, CSS is one of my favorite things to get lost in â€” I always ending up having a blast with it, whether vanilla CSS or a framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind. Anybody else feel the same?

After helping out, I shifted my attention back to my Twitch.tv clone again. Refamiliarized myself with the basic conventions of REST-ful API servers with some Medium articles, then dove into a full day of writing code.

Below are some of the highlights from today:

- Creating a stream via an Action Creator
- Setting up an API server using json-server
- Using Redux's connect function with Redux Form
- Creating a stream with REST conventions
- Dispatching Actions after stream creation
- Key Interpolation Syntax
- Handling fetching, creating, updating, merging, and deleting from inside Redux
- Associating streams with users
- Intentional Navigation vs Programmatic Navigation
- Creating your own Browser History object
- Component Isolation with React Router

Tomorrow, the plan is to start working on React Portals + getting some actual video streaming!
