I've been curious about jQuery lately, so I spent my morning on Youtube working through some topical videos that helped shore-up my base-knowledge of the library. Also completed a couple more LinkedIn Skills Assessments.

After that, my attention naturally shifted back to React. Here's what today's focal points were:

- Hooks in React! (specifically: useState, useEffect, useRef)
- Dynamically toggling classes using state
- Async code in useEffect
- XSS attacks in React
- Throttling API requests
- Event Bubbling
- Debouncing

The project I kicked off to practice all of that^ isn't done yet, but I'm hoping to have everything working by tomorrow afternoon ü§òüèª
