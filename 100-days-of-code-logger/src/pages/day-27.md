Happy Sunday! Today kicked-off with some reading about Redux and then I spent a little time setting up + refamiliarizing myself with Advanced Redux Dev Tools.

PSA: If anyone else is trying to play around with Redux's DevTools, Airbnb has their Redux Store Data publicly available. Just go to airbnb.com, open your Redux DevTools, and start exploring!

After I finished playing with those new toys, I shifted focus to Redux Forms.. Highlights are below!

- Installed + connected Redux Forms
- Customized form fields
- Added form validation
- Integrated error handling and visual error cues on form fields

View the current live version <a href="https://tcs-simple-twitch-clone.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Tomorrow, we shift focus to building out the REST-based functions of this React app.
