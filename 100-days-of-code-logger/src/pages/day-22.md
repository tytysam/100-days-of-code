Keeping the Redux train rolling today! I spent my morning today doing a take-home technical interview and the afternoon learning about Asynchronous Actions with Redux Thunk!

Here are the highlights:

- Redux Thunk and why we need it...
- Tricking Redux with Dummy Reducers
- Fetching data in a Redux App
- Making requests from an action creator
- Understanding (deeply) async action creators
- Middlewares in Redux
- Shortened Syntax with Redux Thunk
