Slowed things down a little today to give myself a bit of a breather.

Spent pretty much the entire day of code refactoring my mini-Youtube Clone. I originally used the project as an excuse to refamiliarize myself with lifecycle methods + class-based components, but now I'm doing a quick rebuild to shift to using Hooks.

Here's what I practiced along the way:

- Refactoring from state to useState
- Refactoring from lifecycle methods to ~useEffect
- Building custom hooks
- Extracting video fetching logic to a custom hook
