Started my day with some much-needed file re-organization + cleanup from 4 months of random personal projects and classwork!

After that, I spent a couple hours playing around on Stephen Grider's RallyCoding.com!

The rest of my day is devoted to biking around Denver, shooting some film, and enjoying the 60+ degree day before it snows more tomorrow!
