New day, new week! Happy Monday everyone!

Threw some time today at learning about some older versions of React and React Router. Not touching these older versions super often, but there have already been a few moments where having some deprecated knowledge has been helpful!

After that, I read tons about:

- React Component Testing using Jest and React Testing Library
- useCallback vs useRef vs useEffect
- Algorithms, algorithms, algorithms!
- Liquid | Shopify Templating Language

Finally, I spent this afternoon doing some video deep-dives on some of the topics I spent this morning reading about â€” ended up being super helpful as far as reinforcing what I learned this morning goes. Mainly focused on some lessons on Jest, RTL, and Liquid.

That's all for today! Tomorrow we're diving into some more advanced React topics... Stay tuned!
