Started exploring VS Code documentation around developing your own extensions! I've had a few ideas popping around my head for a bit now, so I'm stoked to have familiarized myself with the development process!

VS Code's documentation is super thorough and clear ‚Äî if anyone is interested, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension" target="_blank">this is the documentation</a> that I was reading this morning.

Keep an eye on this space: I may have more than just an example-extension built before long üòè
