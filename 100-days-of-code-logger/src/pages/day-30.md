Lots of Computer Science-centric reading this morning! Trying to fill my CS gaps as well as I can, so spent the morning reading about a swathe of things, including:

- Databases
- Troubleshooting
- Algorithms
- Design Patterns

Twitch.TY progress (!!!):

- Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) server setup
- OBS installation and configuration
- Streaming setup and implementation!

Tomorrow, we move on to Context within React!
