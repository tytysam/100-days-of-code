Had a busier day today + it was Friday, so I didn't have quite as much time to throw at code today as I would've liked.

However, I tried to at least get a couple hours throughout the day working on Algo challenges in LeetCode. I've used HackerRank and some others for code practice, but had never actually used LeetCode until today. So, I got an account setup and dove into a few 'easy' algorithm challenges. Made it all of the way through 'Plus One' and 'Sqrt(x)' (eventually).

Really enjoy working through algorithms when I can finally force myself to sit down and just work through them. Fun mental exercises. Hoping to integrate daily (or daily-ish) LeetCode challenges into my schedule here soon.
