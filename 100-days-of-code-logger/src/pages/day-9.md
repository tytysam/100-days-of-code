Code-time today was devoted to making sure every piece of my portfolio is as buttoned-up as it can be!

I wasted over an hour trying to get Google Analytics firing to no avail. Then diverted the rest of my time to refining mobile responsiveness through media queries.

Overall, I'm very happy with the UI and UX of my site — it's clean, crisp, and intuitive while also showcasing my personality. Definitely plenty more that could be added (I'm planning to add lots more detail to my project pages... eventually) but for the immediate, I'm pretty happy with how it's looking.

Check out my current portfolio <a href="http://www.tylercsamuelson.com/" target="_blank">here</a> — I always welcome any and all feedback!
