Circled-back to the custom REPL I was working on last week!

Was having issues with some deprecated dependencies, so it's taken me a few days worth of reading and tinkering to get things up-and-running... And we're only halfway there. But it's officially running locally!

Now I'm just trying to chase down some 400-errors that pop up once I try to shift to a production environment. Esprima seems to be doing some weird things, so starting my investigation there. Planning to throw another hour at troubleshooting, and then probably calling it a day!

Excited to soon have my very own little Read-Eval-Print-Loop Environment! Will mainly use for playing around, testing, and rapid-prototyping.
