Fine-tuned my Figma skills! I've been playing around with a few different programs for designing mockups + wireframes, and I've really come to enjoy Figma. Planning to be better about using Figma (or an equivalent) on non-client work too to get plenty more chances to practice it.

Figma might just have earned itself a spot as my default prototyping tool at this point.
