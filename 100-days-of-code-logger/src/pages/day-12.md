Kicked today off with a couple fun articles about some advanced SVG and CSS manipulations. Now I'm looking for excuses to animate bezier curves in CSS â€” stay tuned..

Otherwise, I circled back to React after my fun-focused reads.

Here's how I split my time:

- Communicating with props
- Structuring apps with class-based components
- Handling async operations with functional components
- Refactoring from functional to class components
- State in React components
