Led today with some more early-morning Liquid lessons! I've built a couple (simple) Shopify storefronts in the past, but diving into the depths of customization has been a ton of fun.

After that, I returned focus to my simple Redux blog project I've been building for a couple days now.

Some topics from today's learning include:

- Pure Reducers
- Edge cases re: mutating a Reducer's input state argument
- Safe State Updates in Reducers
- Equality of Arrays and Objects
- Switch Statements in Reducers
- Dispatching correct values
- Extracting logic to mapStateToProps
- Memoizing Functions
- Action Creators inside of Action Creators!

Tomorrow we move onto React Router and maybe mess with some authentication.
