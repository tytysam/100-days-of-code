I’ve spent the past week throwing time at disparate topics that had ended up on the back-burner + generally just chasing random curiosities, which has been super fun and energizing in its own right.

But now I’m planning to shift gears and focus on refining what I already know, SO: to kick things off, I’m going back to where it all started for me… React!

To kick things off, I made a simple little web application that uses Google's Translate API to translate input text from English to the selected output language.

Here's what I focused on today:

- useState and useEffect hooks
- Making an API call with Axios
- Structuring my own data models
- API setup and auth through Google
