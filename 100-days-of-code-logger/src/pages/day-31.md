Shifting my daily schedule a little bit to make more room for expanding my Computer Science knowledge. Always trying to learn and grow, so if anyone has any recommendations for go-to CS content, please share!

For this morning, I focused on:

- Understanding closures more deeply
- Reinforcing Object Oriented Programming concepts
- Everything there is to know about "this" in JavaScript

Next, I started deepening my code-testing knowledge by reading about + playing around with Jest.

After my reading + learning, I started messing around with Context in React. Planning to build a simple language toggle in order to get some practice with Context..
