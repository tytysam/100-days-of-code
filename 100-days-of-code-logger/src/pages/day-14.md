Happy Monday!

After a few days of troubleshooting, I finally have data reporting from Google Analytics! I hadn't installed tracking code into a website in a little while + my portfolio is built with express-react-views and JSX, it took some finnagling to get the code firing in the right spots. Nice win to start the week!

After that, I set aside some time to work on LinkedIn Skill Assessments â€” check out my new skill badges <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tcsamuelson/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Finally, I did my daily React. Didn't do a ton today as I diverted more of my time to job-centric things today. That said, I still made time to work on handling user input with forms + events and making API requests with React.
