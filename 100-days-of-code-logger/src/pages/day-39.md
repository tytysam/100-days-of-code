Needed a breather by the time today rolled around, so I only set aside part of my day for my #100DaysOfCodeChallenge, the rest has been devoted to personal reading, the dog park, and trying to just slow down and breathe for a moment.

I worked through the classic FizzBuzz algo challenge in a couple different ways, then called it a day.

Happy Friday everyone :)
