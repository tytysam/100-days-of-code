Made some coffee and started my morning by refactoring some portions of my portfolio site. Helped organize + eliminate some edge case issues with the responsiveness of some components. Also added a section highlighting some of my recent projects.

Check out the updates to my portfolio <a href="http://www.tylercsamuelson.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

After that, I spent some time deepening my understanding of lifecycle methods. Then debugged a couple pagination issues with my 100 Days of Code log.
