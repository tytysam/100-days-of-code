Ended up having another day peppered with meetings, so I slowed down a bit on the code front and devoted my day to reading in the in-between moments.

I read a couple long-form articles about various Open Source projects. After that, I did way too much reading about the best React Starter Kits, from create-react-app, to Next.js, to Gatsby.

Also read about some of the best Open Source React Projects. Some highlights:

- Unstated
- React Bootstrap
- WatermelonDB
- React Select
- Evergreen
- React Spring
- Storybook
