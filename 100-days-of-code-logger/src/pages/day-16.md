I spent today building a simple Youtube clone. This React-based app uses Youtube's Data API to take user input from a search field and return multiple videos from Youtube based on those search terms. User can play video in native video player component, or can select a different video from the search results.

Test out my Youtube Clone <a href="https://tcs-simple-youtube-clone.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>!
<br />

I built this simple app in order to reinforce my understanding of the following topics:

- Crafting controlled forms
- Accessing and utilizing Google's Youtube Data API
- Building an app using class-based components rather than functional components
- Leveraging state and lifecycle methods SANS hooks
- Dynamic rendering based on state
- Making API calls with Axios
- Styling content using Semantic-UI
