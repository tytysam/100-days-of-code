I've had some React topics I've been wanting to get to for awhile now, and today ended up being a great day for working through that backlog!

Here's what I covered across those various videos & articles:

- Redux Thunk
- Combining Redux with Firebase
- Dynamic Forms with Redux Form
- Logicless Components with Reselect
- Data Loading Methods with Redux
- Animation in React using ReactCSSTransitionGroup
- Common Errors with React + Redux
- BrowserHistory in Production
- React Integration with 3rd Party Libraries
- JSPlaygrounds for Rapid Prototyping

After that, I spent a decent while playing around with Webpack configurations + my newest side project, my own custom, personal REPL... Stay tuned!
