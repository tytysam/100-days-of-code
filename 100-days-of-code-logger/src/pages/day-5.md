Dedicated today to familiarizing myself with technologies that I currently only really know the name of… in other words, a pleasant, albeit cold Denver afternoon of hot coffee + Youtube and simple coding examples. “Crash course” highlights include: Docker, Kubernetes, Drupal, GCP, and Regular Expressions.

Also spent some time with Dan Abramov's <a href="https://whatthefuck.is/" target="_blank">whatthefuck.is</a>, a nice little (but growing) compendium of explanation-worthy JS terms. (Sidenote: I can never help but recommend Dan's <a href="https://justjavascript.com/" target="_blank">JustJavaScript "course"</a> to anyone new to programming, or anyone who enjoys exploring mental models!)

Learned in lots of directions today, which kinda feels a little obtuse, but I personally see a lot of value in having basic understandings of what each of these technologies are at their most simple level (if only to build better mental models of how they interact/pair with other technologies).
