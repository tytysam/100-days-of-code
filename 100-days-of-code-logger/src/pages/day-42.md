New week, new journal, new job, new goals. Trying to start the week off right!

My copy of <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/design-patterns-elements-of-reusable-object-oriented-software-addison-wesley-professional-computing-series_erich-gamma/248223/item/1566518/?mkwid=%7cdc&pcrid=448918537671&pkw=&pmt=&slid=&plc=&pgrid=107461511234&ptaid=pla-926306231749&gclid=CjwKCAjwgOGCBhAlEiwA7FUXknDco9-13MabXllfmNcc5X77uY2Hd-aQPN-hJ68ezjiPK3c-HP11whoCjN0QAvD_BwE#idiq=1566518&edition=1874193" target="_blank" >Design Patterns by the Gang of Four</a> finally showed up, so today was devoted to finally diving into it! That's it, another real simple day of reading (I've kinda been showering myself with those, but we're getting back to building some stuff tomorrow).
