Today was all about React!

Really enjoying this front-to-back review of knowledge that I've been working through â€” such a gratifying feeling to just _get_ concepts that seemed so deeply dense and confusing just a couple months back.

Here's how I split my time today:

- Making API requests with React
- Axios vs Fetch
- Binding callbacks
- Extracting options to config objects
- Controlled Forms vs Uncontrolled Forms
