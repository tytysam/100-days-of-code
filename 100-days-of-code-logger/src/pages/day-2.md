A little less code, but a lot of video content today. Reading articles + watching videos about GitLab and Unit Testing. Trying to fill some knowledge gaps around DevOps lifecycle tools + CI/CD + deployment pipelines.

Also spent a fair amount of time messing around with Material UI and my custom MUI theme for this site.
