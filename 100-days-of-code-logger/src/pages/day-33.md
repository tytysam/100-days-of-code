Happy Snowpocalypse Saturday!

Built a simple language toggle in order to get some practice with the following topics:

- The Context System
- Getting Data Out of Context
- Creating Context Objects
- Consuming the Context Value
- Context Providers
- "Gotchas" Around Providers
- Accessing Data with Consumers
- Pulling from Multiple Contexts
