Was feeling the itch to build since I've been focused on reading and expanding knowledge the past few days.

So I made a little Sidebar Menu in React! It's a simple React-based component that utilizes react-pro-sidebar and react-icons in order to create a customizable, responsive sidebar library. Features dropdown menus and unlimited number of nested submenus.
