OAuth Authorization was the flavor of the day today!

Did some early-morning reading about the differences between OAuth for Servers and OAuth for JS Browser Apps. After installing a basic OAuth implementation, I then integrated Redux on top.

It's only the basic scaffoling + OAuth at the moment, but if you're interested, you can check out my Twitch.ty app <a href="https://tcs-simple-twitch-clone.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.

A few highlights from today:

- Creating OAuth credentials
- Wiring up the Google API Library
- Updating authorization state
- Handling Auth Status through Redux
- Practice with Redux Dev Tools

Tomorrow, we're gonna try to tackle Redux Forms!
