Shifted game plans just a little today...

I was originally planning on jumping into React Router, but a week straight of working with Redux has my brain feeling fried.. So I played around with customizing some features in a custom Shopify store!

A couple things I worked on:

- Custom components that can be edited from the Shopify frontend CMS
- Working with grids and building some columned sections
- Sticky headers!
- Hover effects for images

Tomorrow we circle back to React!
