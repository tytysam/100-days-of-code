Today was all about the CSS. As a designer at heart, one of my absolute favorite things is playing around in CSS and seeing how I can shift the tone / feel / emotions of a site without ever touching the content. There is so much storytelling that happens implicitly in design â€” trying to harness and focus that storytelling is always a fun exercise.

Bootstrap is likely still my go-to framework, but today was all about Tailwind.

I also threw some time at playing with some more complicated CSS animations / transitions... Read a really great piece by <a href="https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/meaningful-motion-w-action-driven-animation" target="_blank" >Tobias Ahlin</a> about Meaningful Motion with Action-Driven Animation. Spoke to using action-driven animation rather than state-driven animation... super interesting.

More to come!
