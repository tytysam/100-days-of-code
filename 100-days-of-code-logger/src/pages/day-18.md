Happy Friday!

Today I finished up a little mini-project: a collection of simple widgets I've been building to help hone some particular skills.

Altogether, here's what makes up the "collection":

- An Accordion-style component for displaying content (specifically, hiding/showing)
- A Wikipedia-powered Search app
- A custom dropdown-style component
- A Google Translate API-powered translator app

Check out the live collection of widgets <a href="https://tcs-react-widget-collection.netlify.app/" target="_blank" >here</a>.

This is what I ened up getting exposure to today:

- Lots of JSX!
- Binding event handlers
- Filtering lists
- Hiding and showing lists (dynamic rendering using classes)
- Building navigation without React-Router
