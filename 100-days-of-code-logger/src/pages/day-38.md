Spent a huge chunk of the day continuing to read about + mess around with Webpack. Trying to chase down a couple bugs with this JS REPL I've been trying to build and customize.

After eventually hitting a wall, I helped a friend smooth some CSS issues on their portfolio site and then shifted gears to practice some algorithms! Nothing too complicated today, but worked through a couple different solutions for both string reversal and Palindromes.
