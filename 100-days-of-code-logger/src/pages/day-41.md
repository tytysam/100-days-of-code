Made a morning run to the dog park before the rain + snow hit, then spent the rest of today cozied-up inside and reading! Today's core code-centric topic was architectural patterns within software architecture!

I dredged up an article or two covering each of these common patterns:

- Layered Architecture
- Pipe & Filter
- Client Server
- Model View Controller
- Event Driven Architecture
- Microservices Architecture

The rest of the day was spent reading Chuck Klosterman! Happy Sunday!
