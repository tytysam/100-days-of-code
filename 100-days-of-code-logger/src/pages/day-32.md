Happy Friday!

Simple day of code today! This morning's read included learning about CI/CD via Github Actions, discovering some advanced Git commands, and brushing up on my TypeScript knowledge.

After that, I spent some time working through a couple algorithm challenges.

Getting back to React Context tomorrow!
