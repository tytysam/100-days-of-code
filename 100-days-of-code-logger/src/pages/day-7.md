Today was spent refining the mobile-responsiveness of my portfolio site. Few things better/worse than a gracious soul reaching out to let you know that your site looks ~not-great on [XYZ Device]. Shoutout to those gracious souls.

Check out my <a href="http://www.tylercsamuelson.com" target="_blank">portfolio site</a> and be sure to let me know if your phone's display looks anything less than clean | clear | crisp.

Also finally sat down and integrated Google Analytics into my site, so now I have a nice flow of #data.
