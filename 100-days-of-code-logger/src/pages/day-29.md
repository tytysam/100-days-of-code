If you've been following along so far, you have probably figured out that I absolutely love reading — books, articles, comics — any source of learning or storytelling or entertainment and I'm in.

This morning was no different: Did plenty of reading about React Portals, why they're necessary given the nested structure of React components, and how to use them to get around Stacking Contexts and make some modals!

After finishing up building some reusable Modals, I started working on implementing the actual streaming (!!!)

Hoping to have a working, shareable MVP in the next day or two!
