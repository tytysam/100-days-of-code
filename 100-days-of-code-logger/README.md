## ðŸš€ 100 Days of Code - Tyler Samuelson

This Gatsby site is part of my 100 Days of Code journey. For my first day of 100 Days of Code, I wanted to kick things off by building a place for all of my daily progress to live. Thus, I built this "logger" website, with details about what I have worked on each day.

Each day I will post updates here to keep myself motivated, accountable, and moving forward.

You can view the live site below.
